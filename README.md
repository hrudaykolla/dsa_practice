# DSA Practice

This repository contains files and notes related to **Data Structures and Algorithms** (DSA) practice, primarily implemented in **Python**.

## Contents

- Various DSA problems and solutions
- Focus on **Dynamic Programming** with practical implementations

## Dynamic Programming Course

The Dynamic Programming section is based on the excellent course by **FreeCodeCamp**:

ðŸ“º [Dynamic Programming - Learn to Solve Algorithmic Problems & Coding Challenges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk)

- The original course uses Java for demonstrations.
- This repository includes **Python implementations** of the problems discussed in the course.

Sure! Here's a polished version of your **Memoization Recipe** suitable for a `README.md` file:

## ðŸ§  Memoization Recipe

Memoization is a powerful technique to optimize recursive algorithms by caching results of expensive function calls.

### Step 1: Make It Work

* **Visualize the problem as a tree** of recursive calls.
* **Implement the recursive solution** to reflect this structure.
* **Test** the function to ensure it returns correct results.

### Step 2: Make It Efficient

* **Create a memoization object** (e.g., a dictionary or map) to cache results.
* **Add a base case** to return values directly from the memo if they exist.
* **Store the result** in the memo before returning it from the function.

## ðŸ§  Tabulation Recipe

* Visualize the problem as a table.
* Figure out size of the table based on the inputs.
* Initialze the table with default values based on the results you need.
* Seed the trivial answer into the table.
* Iterate through the table.
* Fill further positions based on the current position.
